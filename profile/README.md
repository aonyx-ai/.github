# Aonyx

**Delightful, opinionated Rust frameworks for humans & AI.**

We're building delightful Rust frameworks with strong conventions—designed for
rapid development in the age of coding agents. Batteries included means you ship
features, not infrastructure.

## 👋 About Us

### Why we exist

If you've started a Rust project recently, you know the drill: pick a web
framework, find an ORM that works with it, figure out configuration, wire up
logging, choose an async runtime... Before you've written a single line of
product code, you've made dozens of decisions and glued together a bunch of
crates.

We've been there too, and we think there's a better way. Rust deserves the
same "just start building" experience that Rails brought to Ruby and Django
brought to Python.

### What we're building

We're working on opinionated frameworks that handle the boring stuff so you can
focus on what makes your project interesting. Sensible defaults, common
patterns, and everything wired up and ready to go.

We're also designing with AI in mind. Consistent conventions and predictable
patterns mean coding agents can actually generate idiomatic code that fits right
into your project instead of fighting your architecture.

We're just getting started, and we're building in the open. More is coming soon.

## 🛠️ Projects

### Clawless

A batteries-included framework for building command-line applications in Rust.

Most CLIs need the same infrastructure: async runtime, configuration, logging,
output formatting. Clawless provides all of this out of the box so you can focus
on what your CLI actually does.

**Highlights:**

- Convention-based command structure (file hierarchy matches CLI commands)
- Managed async runtime (just write `async fn` and it works)
- Context system delivering environment information automatically
- Type-safe arguments with compiler guarantees
- Project scaffolding with `clawless new`

Check out the [documentation](https://clawless.rs) to get started, or dive into
the [source code](https://github.com/aonyx-ai/clawless).
